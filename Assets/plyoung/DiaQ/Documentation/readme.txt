DiaQ is a Dialoque and Quest editing tool. 
More information and documentation can be found at
http://www.plyoung.com/diaq/

The Sample
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The included diaqsample.unitypackage can be extracted to see how DiaQ 
is used. Note that this is a sample for the stand-alone product and 
do not represent how DiaQ is used in an environment like plyGame.

It will overwrite the Assets/plyData/DiaQ/DiaQ.prefab when extracted.
The sample scene can be found in Assets/plyoung/DiaQ/Sample/ after
extracting tis package. Study the scripts in the same folder to learn
more about using the DiaQ run-time and editor side APIs.

Remember to also check out the Graph and Quest editors, opened from
menu: Tool -> PLYoung -> DiaQ, to see how the sample Graph and Quest 
are set up.

plyGame & DiaQ
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The for_plygame.unitypackage can be installed if you wish to use DiaQ with 
plyGame. It will add additional features that can be used with these tools.

Note that if you do not have the plyRPG package (part of plyGame) active 
then you should not import the contents of Assets\plyoung\DiaQ\plyGame\plyRPG
Simply untick it in the import window or delete it if you imported it by 
accident as the script in it can only be used when plyRPG is present 
in a plyGame project.
